So right now we want to implement the reasoning capabilities of our agent in react.py. And unlike we did before (in langchain->langgraph), we're not going to use the react prompt. We have something which is better and this is function calling. (checkout in langchain notes about function calling)
So, I'm going to use the bind tools method and supply the tools that we already wrote. And langchain is going to take the tool descriptions and it's going to send that to the LLM. So the LM can now return us this function call or tool calling field with the correct function to be called.And we don't need to handle any parsing because the LM vendor handles the parsing for us.
